<h3>Building ACCURATE Prompts</h3>
<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>You are the chairperson of the Department of Computational Linguistics at a university. Part of your job is to help admissions develop creative course catalogs that would appeal to high school seniors and illicit interest in the programs offered by the university.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>How would you use Chat-GPT to improve the efficiency of your workflow while you take on this task? The first step is to determine what exactly you want to generate with your prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since chatbots are a hot topic, you decide that offering a course on chatbots might be attractive to potential students. That means our first task is to generate a course description.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s employ the mnemonic device of ACCURATE to explore the essential elements that we should take into account when crafting prompt engineering solutions. Then, we can apply each of these elements to our task-specific prompt to generate a desirable output.&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h4>A - Audience</h4>
<p>Consider the target audience for the prompt and tailor it accordingly. Identify the knowledge level, language proficiency, and specific needs of the users who will interact with the language model. Adapting the prompt to suit the intended audience can enhance comprehension and generate more relevant and valuable responses.</p>
<p><strong>Example Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>Can you provide a passage that describes chatbot technology using language that is appropriate for high school students?</blockquote>
<h4>C - Clarity</h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 100%; font-family: inherit;">Emphasize clarity in the prompt formulation.</span><span style="font-size: 100%; font-family: inherit;"> Unambiguous</span><span style="font-size: 100%; font-family: inherit;">&nbsp;instructions help the language model comprehend the desired task or query more accurately. Avoid vague or ambiguous phrasing that may confuse the model and lead to incorrect or nonsensical outputs. Precise prompts enable developers to achieve the desired results effectively.</span></p>
<p><strong>Example Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>Can you provide two paragraphs with 4-6 sentences each that describe chatbot technology using language that is appropriate for high school students?</blockquote>
<h4>C - Context</h4>
<p>Provide sufficient context to guide the language model's understanding. Contextual information can assist in narrowing down the scope of the response, establishing a frame of reference, and ensuring that the generated output aligns with the intended context. Contextual cues may include relevant background information, specific constraints, or examples to help shape the model's response appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Example Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>Can you provide two paragraphs with 4-6 sentences each that describe the origin of chatbots for an audience of high school students that are interested in learning more about computational linguistics? Provide the output in the format of a course description.</blockquote>
<h4>U - User Intent</h4>
<p>Understand the users' intent behind their interaction with the language model. Identify the desired outcome, purpose, or goal that users seek to achieve through their queries. By comprehending the users' intent, developers can design prompts that elicit responses aligned with their expectations, resulting in more meaningful and accurate outputs.</p>
<p><strong>Example Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>Can you provide two paragraphs with 4-6 sentences each that describe the origin of chatbots or an audience of high school students that are interested in learning more about computational linguistics? Incorporate persuasive language to emphasize the importance of the field of computational linguistics. Provide the output in the format of a course description.</blockquote>
<h4>R - Redundancy</h4>
<p>Avoid redundancy in prompts to minimize potential confusion. Repetitive or redundant phrasing can lead to duplicate or conflicting information, which might confuse the language model. Streamline the prompts by focusing on the essential components and avoiding unnecessary repetition, thereby facilitating better comprehension and more coherent responses.</p>
<p><strong>Example Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>Can you create a persuasive description of a computational linguistics course on chatbot technology? The intended audience is high school students. Please constrain your response to 8-12 sentences, in two paragraphs.</blockquote>

<div id="fragment-3" style="overflow: auto:;">
<h3>Looking Towards Automation with ATE</h3>
<p>When automating prompting solutions, there are a few special considerations. For example, if you wanted to help out the admissions department by automating the generation of course descriptions for all of the college courses, you could use a Python script with the OpenAI API.</p>
<p>However, automating prompting solutions still requires that human beings stay in the loop to ensure that outputs are error-free and that they reflect the intended message.</p>
<h4>A - Adaptability</h4>
<p>Ensure that prompts are adaptable to different scenarios and use cases. Design prompts that can handle variations in user inputs or address different aspects of a task. Building adaptable prompts allows the language model to generate responses that are flexible and versatile, catering to a wide range of user requirements.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Example Prompt</strong><br>Can you create a persuasive description of a &lt;department&gt; course on &lt;subject/topic&gt;? The intended audience is high school students. Please constrain your response to 8-12 sentences, in two paragraphs.</p>
<h4>T - Testing:</h4>
<p>Thoroughly test the prompts to evaluate their effectiveness. Test different variations of prompts to assess their impact on the generated outputs. Conducting comprehensive testing helps identify potential issues, biases, or gaps in the prompts, enabling developers to refine and optimize them for improved performance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Example Prompt</strong><br>After using automated prompts to generate the course descriptions, you can compare them to the descriptions of previous years to ensure accuracy. This part of the process can even be automated to flag only problematic outputs for review.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Letâ€™s say that you noticed that your original prompt was useful for subjects in the social sciences but often inaccurate for courses in the humanities. Modifying your prompt to include extra context for the humanities can help generate better outputs. Consider the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Can you create a persuasive description of a humanities course in &nbsp;&lt;specific department&gt; &nbsp;on the topic of &lt;subject/topic&gt;? The intended audience is high school students. Please constrain your response to 8-12 sentences, in two paragraphs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">By trying this new prompt and examining the outputs, we can continue to iteratively tweak our prompt until it generates the desirable answers more frequently.</p>
<h4>E - Ethical Considerations</h4>
<p>Consider ethical implications and potential biases associated with prompt engineering. Be mindful of how the prompts may influence or shape the language model's responses. Avoid prompts that may generate discriminatory, offensive, or harmful content. Strive to ensure fairness, inclusivity, and adherence to ethical guidelines in prompt design.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Example Prompt</strong><br>When reviewing the course descriptions for courses that are outside of your area of expertise, it is best to consult a subject matter expert to ensure accuracy.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="fragment-4" style="overflow: auto:;">
<h3>Avoiding Ambiguity</h3>
<p>Prompt composition involves areas of ambiguity that developers should consider. Let's explore some common areas:</p>
<hr>
<h4>1. Ambiguous Pronouns</h4>
<p>Prompts with unclear antecedents can lead to incorrect outputs</p>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>She told him it was amazing. Who did she refer to?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">In this prompt, the pronouns "she" and "it" lack clear antecedents, leading to ambiguity about the identities they represent.</p>
</details>
<h4>2. Polysemy</h4>
<p>Words with multiple meanings can introduce ambiguity without clarification.</p>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>"I need help with the bank."</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The word "bank" has multiple meanings, such as a financial institution or the edge of a river. Without further clarification, the model may generate responses based on different interpretations of the word.</p>
</details>
<h4>3. Lack of Context</h4>
<p>Inadequate context hinders the model's understanding.</p>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>"What's the weather like today?"</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Without specifying the location or date, the prompt lacks the necessary context for the model to provide an accurate response.</p>
</details>
<h4>4. Ambiguous Queries</h4>
<p>Vague prompts leave room for multiple interpretations.</p>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>"Tell me about cars."</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This open-ended prompt lacks specificity, leaving room for various interpretations. It's unclear whether the focus should be on the history, types, or any specific aspect of cars.</p>
</details>
<h4>Implicit Assumptions</h4>
<p>Unstated assumptions can lead to misunderstandings.</p>
<details style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
<summary style="display: inline-block; background: #394a58; border: 1px solid #8A8B99; padding: 0.5rem 0.75rem; cursor: pointer;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"> Select for Example</span></summary>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>"Find a nearby restaurant."</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Without specifying any criteria like cuisine type or price range, the prompt assumes that the model understands the user's preferences implicitly, which can lead to inaccurate or irrelevant recommendations.</p>
</details></div>
